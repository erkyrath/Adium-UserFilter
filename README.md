This is a crude filter plugin for [Adium][]. It allows you to block any message from a sender with a given account name.

I made this for one reason: to block Slackbot messages when connected to [Slack][] via the XMPP gateway. I wouldn't use it on real people, because XMPP already has features for blocking people.

## Compiling

Compiling Adium plugins requires some fiddling around.
